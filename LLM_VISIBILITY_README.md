4. See how your content would appear to LLMs

### 3. Visibility Analysis

**What it analyzes:**
- What content is visible vs hidden to LLMs
- JavaScript dependency issues

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **LLMContentViewer** (`src/analyzers/llm_content_viewer.py`)
   - Main class for LLM content analysis
   - Simulates LLM web_fetch and web_search behavior
   - Provides raw content extraction and analysis

2. **LLM Visibility Tab** (`app/main.py`)
   - Integrated into the main Streamlit application
   - Provides user interface for content analysis
   - Shows results in an easy-to-understand format

3. **Dedicated Page** (`app/pages/llm_visibility.py`)
   - Standalone page for focused LLM visibility analysis
   - Advanced features and detailed analysis options

### Key Methods

```python
# Get raw content that LLMs see
content_result = viewer.get_raw_llm_content(url)

# Simulate LLM search results
search_results = viewer.simulate_llm_search(query)

# Analyze overall visibility
visibility_analysis = viewer.analyze_llm_visibility(url)
```

## 📊 What LLMs Can See

### ✅ Visible Content
- All visible text content (headings, paragraphs, links)
- Meta tags (title, description, keywords)
- Structured data (JSON-LD, Microdata, RDFa)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Error analyzing LLM visibility"**
   - Check if the URL is accessible
   - Ensure the site doesn't block automated requests
   - Try a different URL

2. **Low visibility scores**
   - Check for JavaScript dependencies
   - Verify meta tags are present
   - Ensure content is server-side rendered

3. **Empty search results**
   - Try different search queries
   - Check if the content matches the query
   - Verify the site has relevant content

### Performance Tips
