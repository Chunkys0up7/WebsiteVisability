# Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation organized by purpose.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### `/research/`
Background research and foundational materials that informed the project design.

- **Understanding Web Scrapers and LLM Website Access_.md** - Comprehensive research on how web scrapers and LLMs access website content, including what they can/cannot extract, the impact of different technologies, and optimization strategies.

### Root Documentation Files

- **Web_Scraper_LLM_Analysis_Plan.md** - Complete project plan with detailed task checklist, technical architecture, dependencies, and implementation phases.

- **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Detailed overview of the project's directory structure, module descriptions, configuration details, testing structure, and development workflow.

### `/examples/`
Code examples and usage demonstrations (to be added as the project develops).

## 📚 Additional Documentation

The following documentation files are located in the project root for easy access:

- **README.md** - Main project documentation with features, installation, and usage
- **QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference guide for getting started
- **SETUP_COMPLETE.md** - Summary of completed setup and next steps
- **IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Detailed task tracking for development progress

## 📖 Reading Order for New Developers

1. Start with **README.md** for project overview
2. Read **QUICK_START.md** for setup instructions
3. Review **research/Understanding Web Scrapers and LLM Website Access_.md** for background
4. Study **Web_Scraper_LLM_Analysis_Plan.md** for detailed implementation plan
5. Explore **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** for architecture details
6. Use **IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** to track progress

## 🎯 Key Concepts from Research

The research document reveals critical insights:

- **CSS-hidden content** (display:none, visibility:hidden) is still accessible to scrapers
- **JavaScript-rendered content** requires headless browsers to access
- **Semantic HTML** significantly improves LLM understanding
- **Structured data** (JSON-LD) helps with AI search visibility
- **Static content** is more reliable for scraper access than dynamic content

## 📝 Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. **Research materials** → `docs/research/`
2. **Code examples** → `docs/examples/`
3. **Architecture docs** → `docs/` (root level)
4. **User guides** → Project root for visibility
5. **API docs** → `docs/api/` (to be created)

Keep documentation up-to-date as the project evolves!
