# Testing the Comparison Feature - Debug Guide

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** üîç DEBUGGING NEEDED

## What We've Fixed So Far

1. ‚úÖ **Tab Display Logic** - Removed `return` statements that were exiting the app
2. ‚úÖ **Session State Restoration** - Restore first URL's analysis after comparison
3. ‚úÖ **Added Debug Information** - Shows what session state values exist

## The Issue

The comparison is **completing successfully** in the backend (visible in logs), but you're not seeing the results in the UI.

From the logs:
```
2025-10-22 10:10:05,902 - Starting comparison between chase.com and wellsfargo.com
2025-10-22 10:10:05,911 - Website comparison completed  ‚úÖ
```

But the UI isn't showing the comparison results.

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Restart the Streamlit App

**IMPORTANT:** The Streamlit app needs to be restarted to pick up the code changes!

1. In your terminal, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the Streamlit server
2. Run it again:
   ```bash
   cd web_scraper_llm_analyzer
   python -m streamlit run app/main.py
   ```

### Step 2: Run a Fresh Comparison

1. In the Streamlit UI, click **"Clear All Analysis Data"** button in the sidebar
2. Enter your first URL: `https://www.chase.com/personal/mortgage-b`
3. Check the **"Compare with another website"** checkbox
4. Enter comparison URL: `https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/`
5. Click **"Start Analysis"**
6. Wait for completion

### Step 3: Check the Comparison Tab

1. Navigate to the **"Comparison"** tab (under Reports section)
2. **FIRST**: Expand the **"üîç Debug Info"** section at the top
3. Check what it shows:

**What you should see:**
```
comparison_enabled: True
comparison_url: https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/
comparison_results exists: True
comparison_results type: WebsiteComparisonResult
```

**If you see different values, let me know what they are!**

### Step 4: What Should Display

If `comparison_results exists: True`, you should see below the debug info:

- **Comparing:** chase.com vs wellsfargo.com
- **Overall Similarity** score
- **Score Breakdown** with:
  - Content Score
  - Accessibility Score  
  - Technical Score
  - Detailed calculation methodology (expandable)
- **Key Insights**
- **Content Comparison** metrics
- **Accessibility Comparison** metrics
- **Technical Comparison** metrics
- **Recommendations**

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "comparison_results exists: False"

**Cause:** The comparison didn't run or failed silently

**Solution:**
- Check the terminal logs for errors during comparison
- Look for line like: `INFO - Website comparison completed`
- If you see an error, share it with me

### Issue 2: "comparison_enabled: False"

**Cause:** The checkbox wasn't checked or state was cleared

**Solution:**
- Make sure the "Compare with another website" checkbox is checked
- Re-run the analysis

### Issue 3: "comparison_url: None"

**Cause:** The comparison URL wasn't entered or state was cleared

**Solution:**
- Enter a valid URL in the comparison URL field
- Make sure it's different from the first URL
- Re-run the analysis

### Issue 4: UI shows "Run the analysis to see the comparison results"

**Cause:** The analysis hasn't been run yet with comparison enabled

**Solution:**
- Click "Start Analysis" button
- Wait for completion (may take 20-30 seconds)
- Check logs for "Website comparison completed"

### Issue 5: Comparison shows but it's comparing wrong URLs

**Cause:** Session state management issue

**Solution:**
- Click "Clear All Analysis Data"
- Enter URLs fresh
- Re-run analysis

## Score Breakdown Evidence

The scoring breakdown should now show:

### For Individual Analysis (any tab except Comparison)

**Scraper Friendliness:**
- Expandable "üìä How the total score is calculated" section
- Shows each component's weight and contribution
- Shows final calculation

**LLM Accessibility:**
- Expandable "üìä How the total score is calculated" section
- Shows each component's weight and contribution

- Expandable "üßÆ Detailed Calculation Methodology" showing:
  - Formulas
  - Your specific calculation with numbers
  - Step-by-step breakdown

## What to Report Back

Please check the debug info and tell me:

1. What does the Debug Info show?
   - `comparison_enabled`: ?
   - `comparison_url`: ?
   - `comparison_results exists`: ?

2. What message do you see below the debug info?
   - "Enable website comparison..."
   - "Enter a comparison URL..."
   - "Run the analysis..."
   - OR actual comparison results?

3. Are you seeing the score breakdown sections in:
   - Overview tab?
   - Comparison tab?

4. Any errors in the terminal?
