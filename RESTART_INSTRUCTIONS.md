# CRITICAL: Restart the Streamlit Server

## The Problem

The Streamlit app is still running the **OLD CODE** from days ago. All the fixes we've made aren't active yet!

## How to Restart Properly

### Option 1: Force Stop & Restart (Recommended)

1. **In your terminal, press `Ctrl+C` TWICE**
   - First press: Tells Streamlit to stop
   - If it doesn't stop, press `Ctrl+C` again
   
2. **Wait 2-3 seconds** for it to fully stop

3. **Check you're in the right directory:**
   ```powershell
   pwd
   ```
   Should show: `C:\Users\camer\Projects\GitHub\WebKnowledge\web_scraper_llm_analyzer`

4. **Start Streamlit:**
   ```powershell
   python -m streamlit run app/main.py
   ```

### Option 2: If Ctrl+C Doesn't Work

1. **Close the entire terminal window**

2. **Open a new PowerShell terminal**

3. **Navigate to the project:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\camer\Projects\GitHub\WebKnowledge\web_scraper_llm_analyzer
   ```

4. **Start Streamlit:**
   ```powershell
   python -m streamlit run app/main.py
   ```

### Option 3: Kill the Process

If the above doesn't work:

1. **Find the Streamlit process:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*python*"}
   ```

2. **Kill it:**
   ```powershell
   Stop-Process -Name python -Force
   ```

3. **Start fresh:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\camer\Projects\GitHub\WebKnowledge\web_scraper_llm_analyzer
   python -m streamlit run app/main.py
   ```

## What You Should See

When properly restarted, you should see:
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
Local URL: http://localhost:XXXX
Network URL: http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:XXXX
```

**NO "Script compilation error" messages!**

## After Restart - Test the Comparison

1. **Click "Clear All Analysis Data"** in the sidebar

2. **Enter URLs:**
   - First URL: `https://www.chase.com/personal/mortgage-b`
   - Check "Compare with another website"
   - Comparison URL: `https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/`

3. **Click "Start Analysis"**

4. **Navigate to the Comparison tab**

5. **Expand the "üîç Debug Info" section**

6. **Tell me what it shows!**

## Why This Matters

Your terminal logs show:
- ‚úÖ Comparison completing successfully in the backend (line 1013)
- ‚ùå But OLD code still running (shown by errors from Oct 21st)
- ‚ùå New code with debug info and fixes NOT loaded

**Once you restart, the comparison WILL display because the backend is already working!**

**Please restart the server and let me know what you see!** üöÄ
