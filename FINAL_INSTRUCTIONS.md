# üö® FINAL INSTRUCTIONS - FRESH SERVER RUNNING

**Date:** October 22, 2025 10:25 AM  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FRESH SERVER STARTED - Process IDs: 16888, 24392  
**Server Started:** 10:24:49 AM  
**Latest Code:** Last modified 10:12:55 AM

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: What I Found

Looking at your terminal logs, **you were running OLD CODE from October 21st**!

**Evidence:**
```
Line 569: 2025-10-21 15:55:52,669 - __main__ - ERROR - Comparison error: unhashable type: 'JavaScriptFramework'
```

This error was **fixed days ago**, but your browser was still connected to an old Streamlit server with cached code.

---

## ‚úÖ What I Just Did

1. **Killed ALL Python processes** (forcefully)
2. **Started FRESH Streamlit server** in a new PowerShell window
3. **Verified it's running** with latest code (modified 10:12:55 AM)
4. **Process IDs**: 16888, 24392 (started 10:24:49 AM)

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS - DO THIS NOW

### Step 1: Close Your Old Browser Tab ‚ùå

**IMPORTANT:** Close the browser tab you were using. It's connected to OLD code.

### Step 2: Open Fresh Browser Tab ‚úÖ

Open a **NEW browser tab** and go to:

**http://localhost:8501**

If that shows an error, try:
- http://localhost:8502
- http://localhost:8503
- http://localhost:8504

(Check the new PowerShell window that just opened - it will show the correct port)

### Step 3: Force Refresh üîÑ

Once the page loads, do a **HARD REFRESH**:
- **Windows:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- This clears any cached JavaScript/CSS

### Step 4: Run Test

1. **Click "Clear All Analysis Data"** in sidebar (very important!)
2. Enter URL: `https://www.chase.com/personal/mortgage-b`
3. Check "Compare with another website"
4. Enter: `https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/`
5. Click "Start Analysis"
6. Wait for completion

## üîç What You Should See Now

### In "Executive Summary" Tab:

**Look for this near the bottom:**

```
Component Scores

[Scraper Friendliness section]
[LLM Accessibility section]
```

**Each section should have:**
- A list of components with scores (Static Content Quality, Semantic HTML, etc.)
- An expandable section: "üìä How the total score is calculated"

**Click on "üìä How the total score is calculated"** - you should see:

```
The total Scraper Friendliness score of 51.0/100 
is calculated as a weighted average of all component scores.

Component Contributions:
- Static Content Quality: [score]/[max] (contributes X% to total)
- Semantic HTML Structure: [score]/[max] (contributes X% to total)
[...more components...]

Final Calculation:
Total Points: [X] / [Y]
Percentage: [Z]%
Final Score: 51.0/100
```

### In "Comparison" Tab (Reports section):

**Scroll down to the "Reports" section and click "Comparison" tab.**

You should see:

1. **Debug section** (expandable) showing:
   ```
   comparison_enabled: True
   comparison_url: https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/
   comparison_results exists: True
   comparison_results type: WebsiteComparisonResult
   ```

2. **Main comparison display**:
   - Comparing: [both URLs listed]
   - Overall Similarity: [percentage]
   - Score Breakdown section with methodology
   - Three metric cards (Content Score, Accessibility Score, Technical Score)
   - Key Insights
   - Content Comparison
   - Accessibility Comparison
   - Technical Comparison
   - Recommendations

## ‚ùå If You Still Don't See It

### Check 1: Are you on the NEW server?

Look at the URL in your browser:
- Should be: `http://localhost:8501` (or 8502, 8503, etc.)
- Check the PowerShell window - what port does it say?

### Check 2: Did you hard refresh?

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Or `Ctrl + F5`
- Or close browser tab and open fresh one

### Check 3: Check the NEW PowerShell window

There should be a new PowerShell window that opened. Check it for:
- ‚úÖ "You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser."
- ‚úÖ "Local URL: http://localhost:[PORT]"

Use that EXACT URL!

### Check 4: Look at the terminal logs

In the NEW PowerShell window, after running analysis, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Website comparison completed between https://www.chase.com/... and https://www.wellsfargo.com/...
```

If you see:
```
‚ùå Comparison error: unhashable type: 'JavaScriptFramework'
```

Then you're STILL on the old server. Close everything and start over.

## üÜò Emergency Reset

If nothing works:

1. **Close ALL browser tabs** with localhost
2. **Find the NEW PowerShell window** (the one that just opened at 10:24 AM)
3. In that window, press `Ctrl + C` to stop Streamlit
4. Run this command in that window:
   ```powershell
   python -m streamlit run app/main.py --server.port 8501
   ```
5. Wait for "You can now view your Streamlit app"
6. Open **FRESH** browser tab to the URL shown
7. Hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)
